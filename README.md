# Unsplash Forum

Hi! We are Eve Strittmatter and Weston Farmer, two students in the Flatiron School software development course. We made this project to demo handling JSON databases and manipulating their data with JavaScript. The site pulls images from the opensource Unsplash photography API and displays them to the viewer who can like or comment. Liked and commented images are  stored in our own db.json and made into thumbnails on the left pane which can be clicked again for later viewing. Please note: This site only works if you both use something like json-server to make a dummy API from the db.json file and if you make a js file with an access key from Unsplash stored as accessKey.
